Item:
${JSON.stringify(item, null, 2)}

Search the web for items currently LISTED FOR SALE that are as close to this as you can find — same brand, same kind of garment, comparable size and condition. Prefer results from ${meta.webUrl}; fall back to other UK secondhand marketplaces if you cannot find enough there.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- You are looking at ASKING prices — what sellers are currently asking. You do NOT have access to sold prices, and you must not claim or imply that you do.
- Prices are in GBP. Convert if a source is in another currency, and say so in the reasoning.
- If you find fewer than three genuinely comparable items, return "low" confidence and a wider band. A low-confidence answer is useful; a confident guess is not.
- Never invent a comparable. Every entry must correspond to a real listing you actually saw.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object — no markdown fences, no commentary:

{
  "low": 0,
  "high": 0,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "confidence": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "sell_likelihood": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "reasoning": "",
  "comparables": [
    { "title": "", "price": 0, "currency": "GBP", "platform": "${platform}", "url": "" }
  ]
}

Rules:
- "low" and "high" bracket what this item could sensibly be listed at on ${meta.name}. Never return low === high.
- "confidence": how sure you are of the PRICE. "high" only when several close comparables agree; "medium" when they roughly agree or are loosely comparable; "low" when they are few, scattered, or only tangentially similar.
- "sell_likelihood": how readily this kind of item MOVES on ${meta.name}, judged from how many people are listing and buying it there. This is a different question from confidence — a common item can have a very well-established price and still sit unsold, and a rare one can be hard to price but sell the day it goes up.
- "reasoning": one sentence, phrased as asking prices — e.g. "Similar Carhartt Detroit jackets in this size are listed at £55–£85." Never write "sells for".
- "comparables": up to 5, each a real listing you found.`;
