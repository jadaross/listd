 * Cheapest model that can actually do each job, checked against live pricing

 *
 *   Sonnet 5   $2 / $10   — supports web_search_20260209
 *   Haiku 4.5  $1 / $5    — older web_search_20250305 only, 200k context
 *   Opus 5     $5 / $25
 *
 * Valuation stays on Sonnet 5 rather than Haiku: it has to judge whether a
 * search result is genuinely comparable to the item, and that judgement IS
 * the product. Everything downstream inherits its mistakes.
